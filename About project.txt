No external assets or scripts were used. The objective of this game is to kill aliens invading your lawn. Letting one enemy pass you is a game over. Right now for the alpha the characters and
enemies are just shapes. Neither is there powerups or sounds at the moment. The game functions fine though at a basic level.
